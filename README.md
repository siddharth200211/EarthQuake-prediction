 Leveraging Python's prowess, I've developed a robust ETL pipeline for extracting, transforming, and loading earthquake data from diverse datasets.
 The predictive modeling is done using cutting-edge techniques to enhance accuracy and reliability.
ðŸ“Š But that's not all! I've brought the data to life with an insightful dashboard crafted using Power BI, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience for data exploration.
ðŸš€ The tech stack? Python for scripting and analysis, Spark for scalable processing, Excel for data manipulation, and NoSQL Booster for seamless data integration.
